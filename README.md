Longhorn is a windows debloater made in python using powershell scripts. Longhorn was made to run with as little user interaction as possible, all from the included python file and scripts.

Longhorn can do these things:

* Block Windows Telemetry
* Disable Intrusive Services
* Remove Cortana
* Remove Default Apps
* Remove Onedrive
* Setup Powershell to run files (also known as Setting up Longhorn)

Longhorn has been tested on Windows 10 Build 1709 on a wide range of hardware. Your mileage may vary while using lower or higher build numbers.
